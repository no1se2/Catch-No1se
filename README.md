# Catch-No1se
This Python script is used to send automatic messages to a website called Catch Chat. The script uses Selenium, a web automation library, to interact with Catch Chat's API and automate the messaging process. The script prompts the user for the name, age, and message to be sent on Catch Chat, and then sends the message repeatedly until the user stops the script. The script also includes features such as colorama, a library for adding color to the command-line interface, and a check for the presence of the Chromedriver.exe file, which is necessary for running the script.
